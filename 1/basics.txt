For very long numbers greater then 64 bits we can use the following method

----> include<stdint.h> header file
then use int64_t nameofthevariabel for 64 bit signed interger, similarly use uint64_t for unsigned int of 64 bits.

To use more than 64 bits usually used only in cp like int128_t,int256_t, int512_t, or int1024_t we need to include boost library instead of #include<stdint.h>
#include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp>
using namespace boost::multiprecision;


Arrays are passesed by refrence only pass it as & when u need to store something in it.


2-d vector printing:
for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < vec[i].size(); j++)
    {
        cout << vec[i][j];
    }
}


vector initalization:
vector<int> row(n,0);
