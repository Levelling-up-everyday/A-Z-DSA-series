For very long numbers greater then 64 bits we can use the following method

----> include<stdint.h> header file
then use int64_t nameofthevariabel for 64 bit signed interger, similarly use uint64_t for unsigned int of 64 bits.

To use more than 64 bits usually used only in cp like int128_t,int256_t, int512_t, or int1024_t we need to include boost library instead of #include<stdint.h>
#include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp>
using namespace boost::multiprecision;
