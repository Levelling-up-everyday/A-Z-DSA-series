Time Complexity is the rate of time taken wrt to increasing inputs.
To calculate time complezity use these 3 steps
1.TC calulated in worst case
2.Avoid constants
3.Avoid lower values

Space Complexity: Memory Space which the program take
it is also define as auxiliary space(space that need to solve problem)+ input space(space that need to store input)

Never manupilate the input

LOOPS:
When there are consecutive loops, we calculate time complexity as a sum of time complexities of individual loops. 
ex: O(m) + O(n) which is O(m+n)
   
     Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed
   
    O(Logn) Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied by a constant amount.
   
   
    O(LogLogn) Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(LogLogn) if the loop variables are reduced/increased exponentially by a constant amount.
